# Hi, I'm etnms
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m etnms. I'm a linguist who develops (full stack) web apps often related to linguistics and languages, for work or for fun. 

## My interests
I have a background in linguistics and computational linguistics. This can be found in a lot of my projects that deal directly, or indirectly, with linguistics and languages. Besides lingusitics I also love space and space related things :milky_way:. This can also be found in some of my projects! 

## Languages that I use
- Javascript/typescript (HTML, CSS, React, Redux, NextJS, Vue, Node) for web applications. Most of my projects revolved around web-development
- C#, I create some Windows desktop apps but also work on some Unity projects in my free time
- Python, mostly for automated my workflow, but also as a backend for some of my apps.
- MongoDB and PostgresSQL :elephant: 
- Java on rare occasions :coffee:

## I'm currently working on
A dictionnary project. I created 2 different apps that allowed me to create a dictionary, and now is the time to work on an actual dictionary. This project focuses on regional languages in France, which are sometimes documented but not always with a web application.

## I'm currently learning
I'm trying to learn more on Machine Learning. I plan on learning more about transformers in the near future.
